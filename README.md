# RokerKit
I don't claim to be as good a weather personality as Al Rocker, but this SDK will Rok your socks off.

I haven't found much in terms of weather SDKs in Swift so I though I would open source the implementations I've done thus far to get others started. Includes: 
* The [new NOAA API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) for weather / waves that is only semi-documented (FREE) 
* The [DarkSky API](https://developer.forecast.io) for weather forcasting and historical weather (semi-FREE)
* The [Powderlines API](http://powderlin.es/api.html) API for SNOTEL data (FREE)

I've used all APIs in my app [WhereToClimb](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/where-to-climb/id1235937478)
